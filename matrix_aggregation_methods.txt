Feature aggregation methods (according to the Image biomarker standardisation initiative)

Methods for GLCM, GLRLM:
2D:
1) (no prefix) features are computed from each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices (BTW3).
	---- by slice, without merging
2) (mbs) features are computed from a single matrix after merging 2D directional matrices per slice,
	and then averaged over slices (SUJT). 
	---- by slice, with merging by slice:
3) (mbd) features are computed from a single matrix after merging 2D directional matrices per direction, and
	then averaged over directions (JJUI).
	---- by slice, with merging by direction
4) (mf) the feature is computed from a single matrix after merging all 2D directional matrices (IAZD).
        ---- by slice, with full merging
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3D:
5) (no prefix) features are computed from each 3D directional matrix and averaged over the 3D directions (ITBB).
6) (m) the feature is computed from a single matrix after merging all 3D directional matrices (IAZD).


for GLSZM, GLDZM, NGTDM:
2D:
1. (no prefix) Features are computed from 2D matrices and averaged over slices (8QNN).
2. (m) The feature is computed from a single matrix after merging all 2D matrices (62GR).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3D:
3. (no prefix) The feature is computed from a 3D matrix (KOBO).
