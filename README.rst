Z-Rad
=====

This is an in-house implementation of radiomics software from University Hospital Zurich. Feature definition standardization according to image biomarker standardisation initiative (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07003).

Installation
------------

Current version of Z-Rad supports Python 3.6-3.9. All releases are tested in MS Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The legacy version of Z-Rad supporting Python 2.7 is available in **python2** branch.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

- joblib
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- pydicom
- pywavelets
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- tqdm
- vtk
- wxpython
- xlsxwriter
- pytorch
- nibabel
- simpleitk


Installing Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably the easiest way to install Python 3 is from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. **Important**: Please download the 64-bit version, otherwise Z-Rad may crash when calculating large structures.

Installing Python packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**With GPU support:** ::

    conda create -n zrad python numpy scipy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn scikit-image tqdm joblib wxpython vtk pydicom pywavelets opencv nibabel pytorch simpleitk xlsxwriter cudatoolkit=11.1
    conda activate zrad
    
**Without GPU support:** ::

    conda create -n zrad python numpy scipy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn scikit-image tqdm joblib wxpython vtk pydicom pywavelets opencv nibabel pytorch simpleitk xlsxwriter
    conda activate zrad

**On USZ PC without admin rights:**

Due to access right restrictions from USZ site, installation is possible either using compiled binary wheels or via ``pip`` through a proxy.

1. **Wheel**: Download the packages from the Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and then go to the directory where the wheel was downloaded. Use the following command to install them::

    pip install <name_of_the_wheel.whl>

2. **PIP through a proxy**: Create *pip.ini* file in ``%APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini`` with the following contents::

    [global]
    proxy = http://username:password@proxy.usz.ch:8080
    trusted-host = pypi.python.org
                   pypi.org
                   files.pythonhosted.org

   This configuration file routes the network traffic related to ``pip``. Do not forget to change *username* and *password* to your credentials.



Configure HD-BET for skull stripping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code was copied from https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/HD-BET. If you want to use it for segmentation, you have to copy the model paremeters from ``K:\RAO_Physik\Research\1_FUNCTIONAL IMAGING\F_Software\radiomics documentation\hd-bet_params`` to ``zrad\hdbet\hd-bet_params``.

Executable
----------

Creating an executable requires PyInstaller (https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io). To generate an executable, run ::

    python generate_executable.py
    
The executable is going to be saved in *exec/* directory. The compilation takes around 15 minutes and the resulting file size is ca. 700 MB.

Documentation
-------------

Please find the documentation in the documentation folder and on https://medical-physics-usz.github.io.

Known issues
------------

List of the known issues related to the software or hardware:

- Python environment without admin rights or IT with conda. It used to work, but somehow now it does not anymore ;)
